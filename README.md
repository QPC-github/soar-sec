# ServiceNow-Functionality
This repository contains code custom functionality that is usable with ServiceNow tickets.

In particular, the current repository contains custom code built for the Security Operations Center module of ServiceNow. All functionality built and checked into this respository is aimed at automating the manual tasks that an incident response engineer may perform. The functionality is designed to reduce the mundane tasks in the life of the engineer.

This open source respository would be useful for other security incident response teams that use ServiceNow as a incident case management system. It includes scripts that allow for routine tasks done by an incident engineer.

# Contributions
We appreciate contributions by other engineers to automate any day to day tasks that typical incident response teams may do in ServiceNow.
